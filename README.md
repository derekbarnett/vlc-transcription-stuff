vlc-transcription-stuff
=======================

This is a collection of scripts which I use with vlc 
(and other tools) to do transcription.

Most of it is ugly but it gets the job done. I use
these scripts in linux by assigning function keys
to control commands for the various scripts.

The meat of this is in vlccontrol.py, which should be
fairly well documented in the file itself with setup
instructions for vlc and the extra tools you'll need
installed to use it.
